	<h1><a href="https://github.com/ZapDotZip/FSChanges">FSChanges</a></h1>
	
	<p>FSChanges is a disk space management app that’s slightly different from most other types of software. Instead of finding the largest files on the disk, FSChanges finds the largest increases in size since it was last ran.</p>
	
	<h4>Why?</h4>
	
	<p>Instead of running the same old disk scanning tool that just tells you all the largest files you already know about and want to keep, FSChanges tells you about what’s been <em>added</em> to your disk, making it easy to find out why your disk space has been filled up suddenly. It will also display what’s been removed.</p>

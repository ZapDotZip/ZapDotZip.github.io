	<h1>Projects</h1>
		<p>This is a list of all of my GitHub projects.</p>
	
	<h3>macOS Applications</h3>
	<ul style="line-height: 1.2;">
		<li><a href="./apps/FSChanges.html"><monob>FSChanges</monob></a> - A different approach to seeing what's taking up space on your drive.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Command-Line Utilities</h3>
	<ul style="line-height: 1.2;">
		<li><a href="https://github.com/ZapDotZip/regesc"><monob>regesc</monob></a> - This is a simple CLI program I made to sanatize a string so it can be used in a regex as just a string. It just takes a line from stdin and prints out an escaped version. It's so simple that the C file is smaller than the README.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/ZapDotZip/cowfriends"><monob>cowfriends</monob></a> - This is a very simple program I made because I wanted to see all of the different options for cowsay without typing each one out manually. It's a single file C++ program. It should work on macOS (homebrew or macports) and probably Linux, so long as your package manager has put cowsay's cowpath in <mono>/usr/local/opt/cowsay/share/cows</mono> or <mono>/usr/share/cowsay/cows</mono></li>

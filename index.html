	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/ZapDotZip/cowfriends"><mono><b>cowfriends</b></mono></a> - This is a very simple program I made because I wanted to see all of the different options for cowsay without typing each one out manually. It's a single file C++ program. It should work on macOS (homebrew or macports) and probably Linux, so long as your package manager has put cowsay's cowpath in <mono>/usr/local/opt/cowsay/share/cows</mono> or <mono>/usr/share/cowsay/cows</mono></li>
